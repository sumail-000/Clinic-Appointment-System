**User Flow:**
1. Staff asks for Patient ID
2. Staff enters ID and clicks "Search"
3. System finds patient in appointment history
4. System auto-fills all fields
5. Staff confirms with patient
6. Staff proceeds to appointment details

**Impact Box (Bottom):**
📊 **Expected Impact:**
- ⏱️ Time saved: 2-3 minutes per returning patient
